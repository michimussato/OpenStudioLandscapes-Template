This is the default place for all images that are
related to documentation. Due to how Sphinx handles
builds, this was the most generic approach I could
come up with to make sure that *if* the README.md
content needs to live *also* in the Sphinx documentation,
the links and references to these images work across both
versions (Sphinx and README).
